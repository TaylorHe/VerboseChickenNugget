## Project Euler #82

Also includes backtracking the full min path

To run,
> python PathSumThreeWays.py [matrix1.txt]

* make sure you're using python 3.X


### C++ backtracking is hella funky, don't use this one
compile with make, run with optional filename, default file is "matrix.txt"

Usage: ./euler82 [filename]
